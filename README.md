open up a Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal, type `haxelib install hmm`

after it finishes, simply type `haxelib run hmm install` in order to install all the needed libraries for *Alsuh Engine!*

## Customization:

if you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can read over to `Project.xml`

inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Alsuh Engine to your liking

to start you off, disabling Videos should be simple, simply Delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file
